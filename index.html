        <h3>Welcome to the AntiSQLi GitHub Page.</h3>

<p>
The AntiSQLi library is a free and easy to use library for reducing risk from SQL injection (SQLi) attacks.
It auto-parameterizes untrusted data for you and best of all uses coding patterns and classes that you're already familiar with. The AntiSQLi library saves you time and frustration, and lets you focus more on building your application.</p>

<p>Integrating the AntiSQLi library takes a couple lines of code and is as easy as the following:</p>

<pre><code>// Automatically assign and parameterize untrusted data
SqlParameterizedQuery pQuery = new SqlParameterizedQuery();
pQuery.LoadQuery("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserName = {0}",UntrustedData);
...
// You're done, execute your SQL statement
pQuery.Connection = new SqlConnection("<your connection string>");
pQuery.Command.ExecuteNonQuery();
</code></pre>

<p>The AntiSQLi library is also highly extensible. We've written .NET classes for Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition, but you can easily extend the library to support other database platforms like Oracle and MySQL.</p>

<h3>Get it on NuGet</h3>

<p>We're currently creating an AntiSQLi package that you can from NuGet, stay tuned.</p>
